# OpenCode Configuration

My personal [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs) configuration — an open source AI coding agent.

Before OpenCode existed, I maintained a personal "second brain". A collection of notes on programming patterns, product management frameworks, and psychology principles. I found it valuable to transform these notes into skills that the AI can execute, making my accumulated knowledge actionable during coding sessions.

Feel free to:
- Browse and adapt skills for your own config
- Use agents as templates for your workflows
- Share tips and tricks you've found useful

## Skills Library

Skills are **executable knowledge notes** — my personal "second brain" converted into actionable guidance for the AI agent.
