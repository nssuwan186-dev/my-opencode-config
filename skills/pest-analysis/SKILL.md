# PEST Analysis for Strategic Planning

A strategic framework that examines four key external factors affecting an organization:
- **Political** (government policies, regulations, tax laws)
- **Economic** (inflation, interest rates, market conditions)
- **Social** (demographics, cultural trends, lifestyle changes)
- **Technological** (innovation, automation, digital transformation)

> 💡 **Note:** Often expanded to PESTLE (adding Legal and Environmental) for comprehensive analysis.

## When to Use

- Market entry decisions
- Product development planning
- Business direction/strategy changes
- Annual strategic reviews
- Competitive positioning analysis

## Initial Questions (Ask Before Starting)

Before creating the PEST analysis, ask 1-3 of these questions to ensure relevance:

1. **What specific decision will this analysis inform?** (e.g., entering a new market, launching a product, pivoting strategy)
2. **What industry/sector and geographic scope should we focus on?** (e.g., SaaS in Europe, healthcare in the US)
3. **What time horizon matters most for your business?** (e.g., next 12 months, 3-5 years, long-term)

Choose the questions most relevant to the context. If the user already provided this information, proceed directly to the analysis.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Define Scope

- Clarify the decision the analysis will inform
- Set scope (industry, geography, time horizon)

### 2. Identify Factors

For each PEST category, identify 3-5 relevant factors:
- Cover all four PEST categories
- Consider industry-specific issues
- Look for both current trends and emerging changes

### 3. Analyze Each Factor

For every factor identified, assess:
- Is this an opportunity or threat?
- What's the likelihood (high/medium/low)?
- What's the potential impact (high/medium/low)?

### 4. Prioritize

- Rank by likelihood × impact
- Focus on top 5-10 factors that matter most

### 5. Develop Strategic Responses

- Create specific action items
- Assign owners and deadlines
- Link to strategic goals

### 6. Review Schedule

- Plan to update every 6-12 months
- Or when major external changes occur

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Watch for these pitfalls during analysis:

- **Too generic factors** — Not actionable, be specific to your industry
- **Ignoring interconnections** — Misses systemic risks, map how factors influence each other
- **One-time analysis** — Becomes outdated, plan quarterly reviews
- **Only focusing on threats** — Miss opportunities, balance positive and negative
- **No follow-through** — Analysis wasted, create action items with owners
- **Using outdated data** — Wrong conclusions, research current trends
- **Working in silos** — Miss diverse perspectives, involve cross-functional team

## Success Factors

- **Involve diverse perspectives** — not just leadership
- **Use current data** — not assumptions from years ago
- **Connect to strategy** — how does this inform decisions?
- **Quantify when possible** — e.g., "15% increase in regulations"
- **Review regularly** — external environment changes fast
- **Make it actionable** — every factor needs a response
